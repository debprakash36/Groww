"""Alembic environment.

Two things here are load-bearing rather than boilerplate:

1. The database URL comes from `Settings`, not from `alembic.ini`. The app and the
   migrations must agree on which database they are pointed at, and a single
   source for that is the only way to guarantee it.

2. `render_as_batch` is enabled for SQLite. Alembic cannot ALTER a column on
   SQLite, so without batch mode any migration run against SQLite fails. The
   target is Postgres, but the test suite and local runs use SQLite, and a schema
   change that only works on the target database is untested until production.
