"""Streaming assembly: token stream in, validated events out (FR-18, FR-19).

This is the concrete resolution of the streaming tension in architecture.md 3.1:
FR-19 wants tokens out fast, FR-18 wants citations validated before the user sees
them, and NFR-1 wants a low TTFT. The design buffers **sentence-wise**, not
answer-wise, so the first clean sentence flushes immediately.

One refinement over the literal pseudocode in implementation.md 5.2, and the
reason for it: that pseudocode flushes a sentence with *no* markers immediately
as "transitional text", but also requires that an answer with zero valid
citations become a refusal. Those two cannot both hold — once transitional text
has been streamed it cannot be retracted. This implementation therefore holds
leading ungrounded sentences until the first valid citation arrives; at that
point it releases them and streams freely. If no valid citation ever arrives, the
held text is discarded and a refusal is emitted instead. The common case (the
first sentence carries a citation) is unaffected: the hold lasts a fraction of a
sentence and TTFT is preserved. The hold is bounded by `max_held_chars` so a
runaway ungrounded answer cannot buffer without limit.

**Escalation condition** (implementation.md 5.3 requires this be stated, not
decided by accident): if the eval set measures a non-trivial rate of answers
where an *early* claim is invalidated by a *later* sentence — which sentence-level
validation cannot catch — escalate to whole-answer buffering and accept the TTFT
cost. Until that rate is measured, whole-answer buffering is not justified.
