"""`POST /chat/stream`: the orchestrated query path (FR-19, FR-20, FR-28).

Implements the request flow in architecture.md 3.1: retrieve, then generate, then
validate citations sentence-wise while streaming. The SSE event vocabulary is
architecture.md 6:

    event: sources          { sources: [{index, chunk_id, breadcrumb, page}] }
    event: token            { text }                       sentence-flushed
    event: citation_warning { stripped_count }             only when non-zero
    event: done             { query_id, abstained, ttft_ms }
    event: error            { code, message }              user-safe only

`sources` is emitted before the first token on purpose (FR-20): the panel renders
immediately so the user can see what the system is reading while it reads it, and
for a refusal it is the entire payload.

Retrieval runs in the (sync) endpoint before the response starts. Generation is
streamed, and the QueryLog row is written from inside the generator so a
client that disconnects mid-answer is still recorded — a query that was never
logged is a query that can never be classified in the improvement loop.

    `done` and no `error` - the user had already read the whole answer and then had
    the connection drop under it. Under load that is not a rare edge; the 50-VU

    - **After the answer was delivered** (`suppress=False`): the answer is real and
      the failure is only in the bookkeeping. Emitting an `error` event now would
      contradict text the user has already read, so the stream completes with a null
      `query_id` and the loss is logged. The one visible consequence is honest:
      FR-29 feedback buttons need a query id, so that turn simply has none.
    - **From `finally`, while an exception is already propagating** (`suppress=True`):
      the failure must be swallowed unconditionally. Raising here would discard the
      original error mid-unwind and replace it with a database error, so the client
      would be told the wrong thing went wrong.
